        <h2>About Coffeefuel</h2>
        <p>
          At Coffeefuel, we believe in more than just a caffeine kickâ€”we craft moments. Every cup tells a story: of carefully selected beans, slow-brewed rituals, and cozy, creative spaces where ideas come to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're powering a morning sprint or winding down with a smooth cold brew, Coffeefuel is your steady companion. Built by dreamers, brewed for doers.
